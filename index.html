							<ul>
								<li>Developing teams in the Army and in Music</li>
								<li>Secured endorsements from several major manufacturers while working as a musician (e.g., Trace Elliot, DR Strings, etc...).</li>
								<li>As a research/methods consultant, I had to work closely with my clients to understand their questions and help them develop the data products needed to meet their goals (e.g., publication, finishing the degree, etc...).</li>
								<li>At BERC group I reengineered the entire workflow for the major work (e.g., classroom observations) and reduced turn around time from 15-20 minutes per school to 9-12 seconds per school.</li>
								<li>Also developed webscraper in Python at BERC (related to being an autodidact).</li>
								<li>In Mississippi I programmed the state's school/district accountability model from ingest to public release.  Used autodidact skill to learn much more about programming/design.</li>
								<li>While working in Minneapolis, I developed several libraries to improve different aspects of the data analysis workflow (e.g., eda, string data processing/handling, etc...)</li>
								<li>Because interdisciplinary work seemed to be an extension of jazz composition, it was easy for me to adapt to new situations/contexts in research.</li>
								<li>The combination of studying Jazz Composition and serving in the Army has also shaped my willingness to adapt to new situations.</li>

					<h2>Statistical Modeling of the Effects of Micro-, Meso-, and Exosystem Poverty on Academic Achievement in Music.</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Sharing this work to highlight some experience with econometrics</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Motivation</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Lots of studies have examined secondary and tertiary effects of studying music on non-music outcomes.</li>
							<li>Lots of studies have also addressed the effects of poverty on student outcomes.</li>
							<li>Much of the literature about the effects of poverty treats the effect as direct, when we know the effect is indirect.</li>
							<li>No studies attempted to examine how poverty affects student outcomes in music.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>The study had personal importance to me having studied music in the K-12 and post-secondary side.</li>
								<li>The information formally released by NAEP indicates substantial performance gaps between ethnoracial groups which was counterintuitive to personal experience.</li>
								<li>Approached the work from Bronfenbrenner's model of ecological development.</li>
								<li>Used cognitive psych/neuroscience studies to inform my understanding of how we learn music.</li>
								<li>Used tools from econometrics to address causal questions.</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Methods</h3>
						<ul style="font-size: 1.5rem !important;">
							<li>Primarily relied on the restricted use 2008 NAEP Music Assessment data set.</li>
							<li>Used Geospatial buffers to join data about community/contextual factors to schools and students.</li>
							<li>Created the instrument-income ratio (IIR) using the average national cost of "school market" musical instruments and estimated weekly income.</li>
							<li>The IIR was used as an instrumental variable estimator (IVE) for the causal effect of a student having their own instrument on the % of correct responses on assessment.</li>
							<li>Additionally, the IVE needed to be adjusted for the sampling design and non-response weighting to derive correct inference.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li><strong>The reason why my background to this point is critical to my research is that I view interdisciplinary research as essential in the same way that we learn compositional techniques from multiple genres while studying Jazz Comp to be able to use those genres when/as needed to make the work whole.</strong></li>
								<li>Need to make it clear how this is related to econometrics</li>
								<li>Instrument Income Ratio - average instrument price for "school market" instruments.</li>
								<li>USDA Poverty Thresholds for 2008 and Median Family Income from the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates set from the Census Bureau</li>
								<li>Adjusted 2000 dollar amounts using BLS inflation adjustments</li>
								<li>Used school market instrument price divided by either median family income or poverty threshold (based on qualification for free/reduced price lunch) to estimate the number of weeks of income it would cost to purchase an instrument.</li>
								<li>Other hypotheses were tested with data that included: </li>
									<ul>
										<li>Urban Institute's Arts Community Index Project</li>
										<li>Occupational Employment Statistics (BLS)</li>
										<li>Non-Employer Statistics (Census Bureau)</li>
										<li>County/ZIP Business Patterns (Census Bureau)</li>

										<li>Common Core of Data Finance, Universe, and Private School Universe Data Sets</li>
										<li>National Associate for State Arts Agencies Grants Data</li>
										<li>IPEDS</li>
									</ul>
								<li>Didn't know anything about psychometrics at this point which is why I used the % correct responses.</li>

					<h2>Meta Matters: Leveraging Metadata to Improve Data Use and Effectiveness</h2>

							<li>Sharing this work since it can generalize to understanding how students are using learning platforms.</li>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Motivation</h3>
						<ul style="font-size: 1.5rem !important;">
							<li>Means, Padilla, & Gallagher (2010) and Means, Chen, DeBarger, & Padilla (2011) had identified using student data systems to improve education as a national priority in 2010.</li>
							<li>Topol et al. (2012) estimated that spending on IT in the K-12 sector in the US would hit $4.7B by 2015 with continued growth after that.</li>
							<li>Despite the importance, not much was known about the types of data consumers within LEAs/SEAs.</li>
							<li>More important, how could SEAs and LEAs make informed decisions about significant investments without understanding use/adoption and understanding the types of data consumers within their organizations?</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Connection to Dr Means wasn't completely clear until I started rereading the report that my team and I put together and I saw that we cited her work in the first paragraph of the document.</li>
								<li>Knowing the types, or classes, of data consumers allows organizations to more effectively and efficiently target support and mentoring by differentiation.</li>
								<li>This was particularly important for FCPS at the time since they were determining whether or not to renew a contract worth roughly $300k/year at the time.</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Methods</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Fitted single and multi-level latent class models with and without covariates.</li>
							<li>Evaluated models that included between two and five latent classes.</li>
							<li>We used AIC/BIC and Entropy to evaluate model fit.</li>
							<li>After classifying users we estimated correlations between the proportion of staff in each class at a school and accountability metrics.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>We approached the research from an exploratory perspective where we would fit multiple models to identify candidates for future confirmatory purposes.</li>
								<li>All covariates were between user covariates.</li>
								<li>Only between subject latent classes were allowed to vary in the multi-level model.</li>
								<li>We also fitted the models including and excluding non-users.  Inference about the number of classes was the same regardless of their inclusion.</li>
								<li>Celeux & Soromenho (1996) state that entropy values approaching 1 indicate clear separation of classes.</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Results</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The retained model used five between user classes and had an entropy of 0.964.</li>
							<li>There were some covariate issues with class membership (e.g., total number of days the system was used and elementary vs non-elementary school users)</li>
							<li>There were weak correlations between accountability system measures and proportions of staff in each class.</li>
							<li>When presenting our work to our Strategic Data Project Colleagues we also illustrated near real-time EDA using process data.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>While the slide deck was being projected, we had audience members come up to a separate laptop that was networked to our main laptop.</li>
								<li>They were able to interact with a dashboard that I created to display accountability system data in Mississippi.</li>
								<li>At the conclusion of our slide deck, we were able to switch our display to Kibana and explain how we were able to ingest and process all of the user activity data and display the activity in near real-time.</li>

						<h2>How does reliability affect inferences about predictive validity claims</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Motivation</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Several states have adopted "kindergarten readiness" measures to use for early childhood education accountability.</li>
							<li>These measures tend to be less psychometrically rigorous than other measures used for accountability purposes.</li>
							<li>Given the nature of "kindergarten readiness" it would be reasonable to assume that there would be substantial evidence of the predictive validity of these measures.</li>
							<li>How does the reliability, or lack thereof, affect predictive validity claims?</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Using sample from Kentucky which uses the Brigance Assessment</li>
								<li>Reliability of the measure is lowest for the age group it is primarily used with.</li>
								<li>CFA discussed in the technical manual indicates the theoretical model doesn't fit the data of the measure.</li>
								<li>Since covariate measurement error biases parameter estimates, how much are the claims really supported by the data if they don't adjust for covariate measurement error?</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Methods</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>We are using Bayesian Multi-Level Models for a couple reasons:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Reliabilities were estimated with an unreasonably small sample.</li>
								<li>In addition to modeling the variance components, we can also adjust for covariate measurement error simultaneously.</li>
								<li>Unlike frequentist approach, Bayesian approach does not require us to treat the published reliability as the true population reliability.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Additionally, Bayesian methods provide a way to avoid issues with solutions that lie along the boundary of the solution space.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>This work is currently being reviewed and no results are available yet.</li>
								<li>If adjusting for the reliability of the measures affects inference, should that lead to a shift in policy and/or prevent others from adopting the same policy?</li>
								<li>While there is a lot known about the effect of covariate measurement error models for a single covariate measured with error, much less is known about multiple covariates measured with error.</li>

			// Because the hidden slides have height and width of size 0 the graphs ordinarily would not render properly
			// until the browser window was resized.  Dispatching this event on the slide change event listener handles
			// this automatically so the end user doesn't need to resize the browser manually.
